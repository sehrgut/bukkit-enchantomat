- longterm: /eom wand: gives the configured wand item
  Hitting a valid enchantomat block with the wand opens its configuration inventory.
  Any items placed inside will be scanned as the valid superset of enchantment-item combinations.
  Items can be created that are a subset of any item within, but not a combination.
- serialize enchanters by block type and location
